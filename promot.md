I need a python app (cmd line) to process reaction dataset to a stardard csv file (the format is dicripted in reaction_dataset_schma.md).

The input will be 2 files, one in rdf format, one is text format, they contain information for same reactions, you need to combined them together. Both of them contains a reation id (In the example I gave to you, for the first reaction the id is 31-614-CAS-39303569). If needed, you can use the id to cross-ref the records. The 2 examples contain the same 500 reactions. Try to analyze both files and find a way to extract all information for the 500 reactions. 

The two example input files are Reaction_2024-1.rdf and Reaction_2024-1.txt
